In this project, I aimed to create an implementation of this [Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1023v7UJwEVSVHFdiI2yzigvg3gr95iBm/view).

## Assumptions:
- Everything is made as said in the Project Doc mentioned above
- Changes made in `vite.config.js` for proxy setup.
- Environment variables need to be set up in `.env` for `MONGO` and `JWT_SECRET`.

## Technical Requirements:

- Languages and Libraries:
  - JavaScript
  - React.js
  - Express.js
  - Node.js
  - MongoDB
  - Tailwind CSS for styling

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1nilaypatel/Car-Rental.git

2. **Install NPM dependencies (in root folder) for server side:**
    ```bash
    npm install

3. **Start the server (in root folder):**
